## üß† Under the Hood

### ReviewAnalyzer Class

The heart of the application is the ReviewAnalyzer class, which:

- Cleans and preprocesses text data
- Performs sentiment analysis on reviews
- Extracts key topics using LDA
- Identifies important product features using TF-IDF
- Generates recommendations based on aggregated metrics

### Data Processing

The application uses several sophisticated NLP techniques:

- *Tokenization*: Breaking text into individual words
- *Stopword Removal*: Filtering out common words that don't add meaning
- *Sentiment Analysis*: Evaluating the emotional tone of reviews
- *Topic Modeling*: Identifying themes and topics across reviews
- *TF-IDF Vectorization*: Highlighting important terms
